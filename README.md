I'm a Technology Engineer specializing in configuration management. Currently, that includes a lot of Puppet and Terraform, but I'm familiar with most of the popular
configuration management tools.

My original plan in life was to something in the electrical engineering field. That didn't really work out as intended, so instead I tend to spend much of my free time
playing with all things hardware. Build computers, play with embedded systems, program FPGAs, etc. But I also dabble in web development (Rails) and am currently learning
Golang. It's a work-in-progress, but I'm getting there.

I also play entirely too many video games, most notably World of Warcraft, but I'm also a big FPS & RTS fan. If you do find me outside for any length of time, it's
usually enjoying one of the typical "outdoorsy" activities: camping, fishing, skiing, hiking,
