I'm a Cloud Engineer specializing in configuration management, infrastructure-as-code, and CI/CD. Currently, that includes a lot of Terraform, but I'm familiar with most of the popular
tooling out there--Ansible, Chef, ArgoCD, Jenkins, and my all-time favorite tool: Puppet.

My original plan in life was to something in the electrical engineering field. That didn't really work out as intended, so instead I tend to spend much of my free time
playing with all things hardware. Build computers, play with embedded systems, program FPGAs, etc. But I also dabble in web development and am currently learning Golang to the best
of my ability. It's a work-in-progress, but I'm getting there.

#### :octocat: Notable Repositories

Most of the repositories I work on a daily basis are private. But on the rare occasion I am able to post something open source and it's something I think
will be useful, I'll post it below.

- [ragnarkon/puppet-lint-deprecation-check](https://github.com/ragnarkon/puppet-lint-deprecation-check) - Puppet Lint plugin to check for deprecated code.
