I'm a Technology Engineer specializing in configuration management. Currently, that includes a lot of Puppet and Terraform, but I'm familiar with most of the popular
configuration management tools.

My original plan in life was to something in the electrical engineering field. That didn't really work out as intended, so instead I tend to spend much of my free time
